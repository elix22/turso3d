Experimental 3D / game engine technology partially based on the Urho3D codebase. Expected to remain in an immature or "toy" state for the time being.

Goals:<br>
- Minimally intrusive structure that is more a library than a framework<br>
- Utilize modern rendering API's<br>
- Minimal 3rd party dependencies<br>
- Cache- and multithreading-friendly data structures and operation<br>
- Unified representation (scene graph) for 3D scene and UI<br>
